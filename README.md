Pulses in Cables (`analysis.py`)
- Studied pulse propagation, reflection, and transmission in transmission lines.

Charge-to-Mass
- Measured the charge-to-mass ratio (e/m) using electron beam deflection in magnetic and electric fields.  

Photoelectric Effect
- Investigated the relationship between light frequency and photoelectron emission.
